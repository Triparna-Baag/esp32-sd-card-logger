# Mini Project: ESP32 Logging Data to SD Card
This repository contains multiple versions of ESP32-based data loggers.  
Each version demonstrates how to log sensor data (such as temperature and humidity) to an SD card, with optional OLED display output and further extensions like MQTT communication and RTC integration.


- **Version 1:** Basic SD card logger (serial + file logging)
- **Version 2:** SD card logger + OLED + DHT11 sensor
- **Version 3:** MQTT communication protocol(IoT enabled) + SD card logger + OLED + DHT11 sensor
- **Version 4:** RTC for Timestamped Logging + SD card + DHT11 + OLED
